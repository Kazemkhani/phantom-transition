# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Amelia, a sales development representative at Beacon Reach. You are making an outbound call to Adam at Skyline Realty, a estate brokerage, who asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Beacon Reach, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Interjection addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with what the user said when interrupting, rather than ignoring it.
3. Workflow resumed: after addressing the interjection, the response returns to the call flow with a fresh start.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sba7ed508db", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}
