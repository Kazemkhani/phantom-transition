# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Karim, a sales development representative at Harbour Line. You are making an outbound call to Layla at Marina Homes, a estate brokerage, who asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Harbour Line, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi, is that Layla? This is Karim calling from Harbour Line. You asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries through our website last week, so I wanted to give you a quick call about it.
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Is this something you'd decide on yourself, or <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>I'm not really comfortable going into that on the phone, to be honest.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Understood, no pressure at all. We can keep it high level. So, briefly, what we'd do for you is this: we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. It's built for enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, and brokerages we work with typically see the enquiry-to-viewing rate move from roughly one in ten to one in four. Is that the sort of thing you were after?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "s30ede25b07", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?

assistant: When would you ideally want something <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Why do you need to know that? Seems like a lot of questions.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Reasonable question. It's so I recommend the right thing, not the default one. Let me give you the short version of what we do. we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. That's aimed at trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. How does that sound?
