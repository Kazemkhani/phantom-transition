# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Amelia, a sales development representative at Driveline Contact. You are making an outbound call to Hamza at Horizon Auto, a car dealership, who asked about test-drive follow-up through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Driveline Contact, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Hamza, Amelia here from Driveline Contact. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about test-drive follow-up. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Yes, that's right, go on.
assistant: Who would need to sign off on something like this at your end?
user: It's my decision for anything under a certain size, and this would be under it.
assistant: Is there a date you're working towards, <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, correction on what I said earlier: it's not just me who decides, my partner would need to be in on it too.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: or is it more of a when-we-get-to-it thing?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.
3. Corrected value integrated: the response reflects the corrected information rather than the original value, and then continues the call flow.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "se26f4f5bd8", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

## Assistant system prompt
You are Daniel, a sales development representative at Trialbridge. You are making an outbound call to Nour at Stackform, a software firm, who asked about qualifying trial sign-ups through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Trialbridge, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hello, could I speak to Nour? It's Daniel here from Trialbridge. You asked about qualifying trial sign-ups recently and I promised we would follow up by phone.
user: Yes, this is Nour.
assistant: Is this something you'd decide on <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, just so you know, I've only got about five minutes before my next meeting.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's fine, five minutes is plenty. In short: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. That's the piece that covers trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. Does that sound right for you?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Interjection addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with what the user said when interrupting, rather than ignoring it.
3. Workflow resumed: after addressing the interjection, the response returns to the call flow with a fresh start.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sdebea5647a", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

assistant: Good morning, Adam, it's Tariq from Clearline Care. I'm ringing because you asked about reducing missed appointments on our site, and I wanted to follow that up with you directly.
user: Yes, that's right, go on.
assistant: To make sure I point you at the right thing, what is the main issue you were hoping to sort out? Is it the no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty, or something else?
user: Honestly, yes, it's mostly the no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty. That's the bit that bothers me.
assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? How many front desk would this be covering?
user: Roughly 6, plus a couple of part-timers.
assistant: Great, that helps me a lot. Briefly, then: we call every patient the day before, confirm or rebook them on the spot, and fill the gaps from your waiting list. From what you've told me about the <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>We're not looking to change anything right now, honestly.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty, that's the fit, and clinics we work with usually cut no-shows by about a third in the first month. Does that match what you were hoping for?

2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sedab29c27c", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? How many account executives would this be covering?
user: Roughly 15, plus a couple of part-timers.
assistant: Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?
user: Nothing formal, but three thousand a month wouldn't be a problem.
assistant: Perfect, thanks. Here is the short version of what we do: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Separate thing, do you have an office here I could actually come and visit?</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: We do, and you're welcome to visit. I'll send the address with the follow-up. Here's the gist, then. we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. Given trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, that's the fit, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. What do you think?

## Recovery criteria

3. Steered back: after addressing the new topic, the response returns to the original call flow without blending the two.

## Output

user: About 12. It was fewer last year, so we're growing.
assistant: Have you set aside a budget for this, or is that still to be worked out?
user: Not a fixed one, but something around ten thousand a month would be fine if it works.
assistant: That's useful, thank you. Let me tell you how we'd help. In short, we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. Given what you said about trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, this is the piece that's <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Oh, before I forget, can you email me something I can forward to my partner?</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's fine, five minutes is plenty. So, briefly, what we'd do for you is this: we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. It's built for enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, and brokerages we work with typically see the enquiry-to-viewing rate move from roughly one in ten to one in four.

user: 6, across the two sites.
assistant: Can I ask what prompted the enquiry? Was it the no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty, or a different problem?
user: Pretty much that. We lose a lot to that, more than I'd like.
assistant: Great, that helps me a lot. Briefly, then: we call every patient the day before, confirm or rebook them on the spot, and fill the gaps from your waiting list. From what you've told me <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, sorry, wait, I gave you the wrong number earlier. It's more like 12, not 6.</INTERRUPTION>

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi there, is this Oliver? Daniel from Freightreach. You asked about chasing delivery paperwork last week, and I wanted to make sure someone actually called you back about it.
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: To make sure I point you at the right thing, what is the main issue you were hoping to sort out? Is it the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing, or something else?
user: It's that, and just generally not having enough hands to keep up.
assistant: And if this were a good fit, who would make the final call on it? Would that be you, or someone else?
user: That would be me, mostly. I'd loop in my partner but it's my call.
assistant: Great, that helps me a lot. Briefly, then: we chase the paperwork by phone for you, log what comes back, and flag the ones that need escalating. From what you've told me about the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing, that's <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>We're not looking to change anything right now, honestly.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Completely reasonable. I'm happy just to leave you with the details. In short: we chase the paperwork by phone for you, log what comes back, and flag the ones that need escalating. That's the piece that covers the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing, and operators we work with usually get paperwork turnaround down from days to hours. Does that sound right for you?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

## Output

user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, sorry, wait, I gave you the wrong number earlier. It's more like 21, not 15.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: what you've said about the test-drive enquiries that never get a second call, that's exactly the gap we cover, and dealers we work with usually see booked test drives go up by about a quarter. How does that sound to you?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.
3. Corrected value integrated: the response reflects the corrected information rather than the original value, and then continues the call flow.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sc1dcb1a3e8", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}
