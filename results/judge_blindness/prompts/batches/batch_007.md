# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

Judgement id: s7a9be5a424

## Assistant system prompt
You are Omar, a sales development representative at Beacon Reach. You are making an outbound call to Dina at Skyline Realty, a estate brokerage, who asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Beacon Reach, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hello, could I speak to Dina? It's Omar here from Beacon Reach. You asked about <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Just to add, we've got two offices, not one, in case that matters.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Good to know, we can cover both. Let me start again properly. I'm Omar, calling from Beacon Reach, about the enquiry you left with us. Am I speaking with Dina?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Interjection addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with what the user said when interrupting, rather than ignoring it.
3. Workflow resumed: after addressing the interjection, the response returns to the call flow with a fresh start.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "s7a9be5a424", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

Judgement id: s9a22ef9eb8

## Assistant system prompt
You are Leah, a sales development representative at Driveline Contact. You are making an outbound call to Ethan at Westgate Motors, a car dealership, who asked about test-drive follow-up through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Driveline Contact, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi, is that Ethan? This is Leah calling from Driveline Contact. You asked about test-drive follow-up through our website <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, while I've got you, do you also do websites? Ours is a mess.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Not websites, no, but I know a couple of people I can put you in touch with. Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. New topic engaged: the response explicitly addresses the user's off-topic request or question.
3. Steered back: after addressing the new topic, the response returns to the original call flow without blending the two.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "s9a22ef9eb8", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

## Request 3 of 25

Judgement id: s21ac21d355

## Assistant system prompt
You are Yusuf, a sales development representative at Onboard Reach. You are making an outbound call to Ibrahim at Northwind Software, a software firm, who asked about qualifying trial sign-ups through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Onboard Reach, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi, is that Ibrahim? This is Yusuf calling from Onboard Reach. You asked about qualifying trial sign-ups through our website last week, so I wanted to give you a quick call about it.
user: Yes, that's right, go on.
assistant: How big is the team on your side? Roughly how many account executives are we talking about?
user: About 12. It was fewer last year, so we're growing.
assistant: Have you set aside a budget for this, or is that still to be worked out?
user: Not a fixed one, but something around ten thousand a month would be fine if it works.
assistant: That's useful, thank you. Let me tell you how we'd help. In short, we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. Given what you said about trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, this is the piece that's <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Oh, before I forget, can you email me something I can forward to my partner?</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: I can, I'll send something you can forward on. Here's the gist, then. we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. Given trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, that's the fit, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. What do you think?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. New topic engaged: the response explicitly addresses the user's off-topic request or question.
3. Steered back: after addressing the new topic, the response returns to the original call flow without blending the two.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "s21ac21d355", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

## Assistant system prompt
You are Daniel, a sales development representative at Meridian Patient Services. You are making an outbound call to Oliver at Oakview Clinic, a dental clinic, who asked about reducing missed appointments through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Meridian Patient Services, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Oliver, Daniel here from Meridian Patient Services. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about reducing missed appointments. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Is there a budget attached to this yet, even a ballpark?
user: Not a fixed one, but something around ten thousand a month would be fine if it works.
assistant: Is this something you'd decide on yourself, <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>I'm not really comfortable going into that on the phone, to be honest.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's completely fair, and you don't need to. We can keep this general. Let me give you the short version of what we do. we call every patient the day before, confirm or rebook them on the spot, and fill the gaps from your waiting list. That's aimed at the no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty, and clinics we work with usually cut no-shows by about a third in the first month. How does that sound?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "s8b2e8cc813", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

assistant: Hi there, is this Hamza? Priya from Motorway Follow-Up. You asked about test-drive follow-up last week, and I wanted to make sure someone actually called you back about it.
user: Yes, speaking. Go ahead.
assistant: Have you set aside a budget for this, or is that still to be worked out?
user: There's a budget. Around seven thousand monthly, depending on what's included.
assistant: Is this something you'd decide on yourself, or would it go to someone else?
user: That would be me, mostly. I'd loop in my partner but it's my call.
assistant: Right, that gives me a clear picture. So, what we would do for you is this: we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>We're not looking to change anything right now, honestly.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: the morning of. It's aimed squarely at the test-drive enquiries that never get a second call, and dealers we work with usually see booked test drives go up by about a quarter. Is that roughly what you were looking for?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi, is that Layla? This is Daniel calling from Depot Line. You asked about chasing delivery paperwork through our website last week, so I wanted to give you a quick call about it.
user: Oh right, yes, I remember filling that in. Go ahead.
assistant: Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's completely fair, and you don't need to. We can keep this general. Here's the gist, then. we chase the paperwork by phone for you, log what comes back, and flag the ones that need escalating.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Oliver, Maya here from Signal Desk. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about qualifying trial sign-ups. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?
user: Not a fixed one, but something around seven thousand a month would be fine if it works.
assistant: And if this were a good fit, who would make the final call on it? Would that be you, or someone else?
user: That would be me, mostly. I'd loop in my partner but it's my call.
assistant: Thanks, that's really helpful.

Here's the gist, then. we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives.
