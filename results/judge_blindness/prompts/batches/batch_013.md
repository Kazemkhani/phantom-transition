# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Amelia, a sales development representative at Clearline Care. You are making an outbound call to Nadia at Bayside Smiles, a dental clinic, who asked about reducing missed appointments through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Clearline Care, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hello, could I speak to Nadia? It's Amelia here from Clearline Care. You asked about reducing missed appointments recently and I promised we would follow up by phone.
user: Yes, speaking. Go ahead.
assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? How many front desk would this be covering?
user: 6, across the two sites.
assistant: Can I ask what prompted the enquiry? Was it the no-shows and the late cancellations that leave a chair empty, or a different problem?
user: Pretty much that. We lose a lot to that, more than I'd like.
assistant: Great, that helps me a lot. Briefly, then: we call every patient the day before, confirm or rebook them on the spot, and fill the gaps from your waiting list. From what you've told me <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, sorry, wait, I gave you the wrong number earlier. It's more like 12, not 6.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Got it, I'll make that 12. Lovely, that's booked for Friday at two. You'll get a calendar invite shortly. Thanks, Nadia, speak soon.

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.
3. Corrected value integrated: the response reflects the corrected information rather than the original value, and then continues the call flow.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sa73ee12622", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

So, briefly, what we'd do for you is this: we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them the morning of.

assistant: What sort of timeline are you working to? Is this something you want in place this month, or later in the year?
user: No hard date, but this quarter would be good.
assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Why do you need to know that? Seems like a lot of questions.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Reasonable question. It's so I recommend the right thing, not the default one. Let me give you the short version of what we do. we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them the morning of. That's aimed at the test-drive enquiries that never get a second call, and dealers we work with usually see booked test drives go up by about a quarter. How does that sound?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

## Output

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Faisal, Amelia here from Trialbridge. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about qualifying trial sign-ups. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Oh right, yes, I remember filling that in. Go ahead.
assistant: Is there a date you're working towards, or is it more of a when-we-get-to-it thing?
user: Sooner rather than later. Within a few weeks if it's straightforward.
assistant: To make sure I point you at the right thing, what is the main issue you were hoping to sort out? Is it trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, or something else?
user: Pretty much that. We lose a lot to that, more than I'd like.
assistant: Right, that gives me a clear picture.

user: <INTERRUPTION>Just to add, we've got two offices, not one, in case that matters.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Thanks, that's useful, two offices is no problem.

Given trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, that's the fit, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. What do you think?
