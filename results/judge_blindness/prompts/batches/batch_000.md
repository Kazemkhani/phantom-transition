# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Karim, a sales development representative at Freightreach. You are making an outbound call to Reem at Coastline Logistics, a logistics firm, who asked about chasing delivery paperwork through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Freightreach, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Reem, Karim here from Freightreach. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about chasing delivery paperwork. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: So I understand where you are, what's the thing that's costing you most at the moment? Is it the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing?
user: It's that, and just generally not having enough hands to keep up.
assistant: When would you ideally want something <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>I'm not really comfortable going into that on the phone, to be honest.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: like this running by?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Non-defensive tone: the response contains no dismissive or argumentative language and does not blame the user.
3. Concern addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with the user's stated concern by giving a reason or offering an alternative, rather than ignoring it.

assistant: How big is the team on your side? Roughly how many sales team are we talking about?

assistant: Have you set aside a budget for this, or is that still to be worked out?

Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi there, is this Rashid? Sam from Onboard Reach. You asked about qualifying trial sign-ups last week, and I wanted to make sure someone actually called you back about it.
user: Yes, this is Rashid.
assistant: Can I ask what prompted the enquiry? Was it trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, or a different problem?
user: It's that, and just generally not having enough hands to keep up.
assistant: What sort of timeline are you working to? Is this something you want in place this month, or later in the year?
user: We'd want it before the summer, realistically.
assistant: Perfect, thanks. Here is the short version of what we do: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. That maps directly onto trial sign-ups that <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Hang on, I said it was mostly that problem, but honestly the bigger issue is the admin side of it.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Thanks for that, the admin side, understood. So, briefly, what we'd do for you is this: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route the serious ones to your account executives. It's built for trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet, and software teams we work with typically double the share of trials that get a human conversation in week one. Is that the sort of thing you were after?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.
3. Corrected value integrated: the response reflects the corrected information rather than the original value, and then continues the call flow.

assistant: Perfect, thanks. Here is the short version of what we do: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and route <INTERRUPTED />

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi there, is this George? Yusuf from Candor Reach. You asked about phone screening for inbound candidates last week, and I wanted to make sure someone actually called you back about it.
user: That's me. What's this about?
assistant: When would you ideally <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, quick one, can you speak up a bit? The line's a little faint at my end.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Sorry about that, I'll speak up. So, briefly, what we'd do for you is this: we phone every inbound applicant within the hour, run the basic screen, and pass on only the ones who meet the brief. It's built for the hours your recruiters spend on first-round calls with people who were never a fit, and agencies we work with typically get recruiter time on first screens down by half. Is that the sort of thing you were after?

## Conversation history
assistant: Good morning, Adam, it's Tariq from Northgate Outreach. I'm ringing because you asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries on our site, and I wanted to follow that up with you directly.
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: How big is the team on your side? Roughly how many agents are we talking about?
user: We're at 4 at the moment, give or take.
assistant: Is this something you'd decide on yourself, or <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, sorry, wait, I gave you the wrong number earlier. It's more like 10, not 4.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Got it, I'll make that 10. Here's the gist, then. we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. Given enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, that's the fit, and brokerages we work with typically see the enquiry-to-viewing rate move from roughly one in ten to one in four. What do you think?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.

user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, how did you get my number?</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's a fair question. It came through the enquiry form on our website, and I can remove it if you'd prefer. In short: we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. That's the piece that covers enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, and brokerages we work with typically see the enquiry-to-viewing rate move from roughly one in ten to one in four.
