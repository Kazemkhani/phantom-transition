# Judgement requests

## System prompt (applies to every request below)

You are a strict judge for spoken dialogue systems. You evaluate how well an assistant fulfils its task and recovers after being interrupted mid-utterance.

You will be given:
- The assistant's system prompt, which defines the call flow it must follow
- A conversation history where the assistant was interrupted
- A list of recovery criteria the response must satisfy
- The assistant's response to evaluate

Transcript format:
- If an assistant message ends with <INTERRUPTED />, it was cut off at that exact point. The rest was never delivered.
- A user message wrapped in <INTERRUPTION>...</INTERRUPTION> is what the user said while interrupting.

Score two axes, each from 1 to 5:
- task_fulfilment: how well the response accomplishes what the assistant should do next according to its system prompt and the conversation so far, that is, whether it advances the call along the correct next step given what has actually been established with the caller. Judge on task advancement only, not naturalness, grammar, tone, length or recovery style. "More detail", "more comprehensive", "more specific" or "longer" are not reasons for a higher score.
- recovery_quality: whether the response correctly recovers from the interruption, assessed against the listed criteria. Be strict: "close enough" is not a pass. Score 5 only if every criterion is clearly satisfied; score 1 if most criteria are not met. Do not introduce your own criteria beyond what is provided for this axis.

Then answer two further questions:
- anything_wrong: did anything go wrong in this interaction? Describe it briefly in one or two sentences, or write the single word "nothing".
- premature_advance: was the caller moved forward in the call flow without the assistant finishing the step that justifies it? Answer "yes" or "no".

Output exactly one JSON object with the keys "id", "task_fulfilment", "recovery_quality", "anything_wrong" and "premature_advance", and nothing else. Copy the id exactly as given.

1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Motorway Follow-Up, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.
3. Pitch: present the offer, tailored to what the caller told you in discovery, and let them react before proposing next steps.
4. Close: propose a specific day and time for a twenty-minute follow-up call with a specialist, and confirm it.
Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

assistant: Hi there, is this Nadia? Karim from Motorway Follow-Up. You asked <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Hang on, are you the ones who were meant to send me a brochure? Because it never arrived.</INTERRUPTION>

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. New topic engaged: the response explicitly addresses the user's off-topic request or question.
3. Steered back: after addressing the new topic, the response returns to the original call flow without blending the two.

## Output
Return exactly one JSON object: {"id": "sd0d8cd7deb", "task_fulfilment": <1-5>, "recovery_quality": <1-5>, "anything_wrong": "<text or nothing>", "premature_advance": "<yes or no>"}

Let me give you the short version of what we do. we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them the morning of.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi there, is this Layla? Sophie from Onboard Reach. You asked about qualifying trial sign-ups last week, and I wanted to make sure someone actually called you back about it.
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: So I understand where you are, what's the thing that's costing you most at the moment? Is it trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet?
user: Honestly, yes, it's mostly trial sign-ups that nobody speaks to until they have already gone quiet. That's the bit that bothers me.
assistant: Is there a budget attached to this yet, even a ballpark?
user: There's a budget. Around ten thousand monthly, depending on what's included.
assistant: Perfect, thanks. Here is the short version of what we do: we call each new trial within ten minutes, find out what they are trying to do, and <INTERRUPTED />

You are Hannah, a sales development representative at Motorway Follow-Up. You are making an outbound call to Mona at Westgate Motors, a car dealership, who asked about test-drive follow-up through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Motorway Follow-Up, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Mona, Hannah here from Motorway Follow-Up. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about test-drive follow-up. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Oh right, yes, I remember filling that in. Go ahead.
assistant: Who would need to sign off on something like this at your end?
user: It's my decision for anything under a certain size, and this would be under it.
assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? How many sales team would this be covering?
user: We're at 15 at the moment, give or take.
assistant: Thanks, that's really helpful. So here is what we do, briefly: we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them the morning of. Based on <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Actually, sorry, wait, I gave you the wrong number earlier. It's more like 21, not 15.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: Thanks, I've changed that to 21. Here's the gist, then. we follow up every test-drive enquiry the same day, book the slot, and remind them the morning of. Given the test-drive enquiries that never get a second call, that's the fit, and dealers we work with usually see booked test drives go up by about a quarter. What do you think?

## Recovery criteria

2. Correction accepted: the response accepts the user's correction without pushback or argument.

## Assistant system prompt
You are Sophie, a sales development representative at Beacon Reach. You are making an outbound call to Layla at Palm Row Properties, a estate brokerage, who asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries through the website. Follow this call flow in order.
1. Greeting: introduce yourself and Beacon Reach, say why you are calling, and confirm you are speaking with the right person.
2. Discovery: ask qualification questions (about their need, team size, budget, who decides, and timeline) and get clear answers to at least two of them before presenting the offer.

Do not move to a later stage until the earlier stage is complete. If the caller interrupts, deal with what they said, then resume the flow. Keep every turn short; this is a phone call.

## Conversation history
assistant: Hi Layla, Sophie here from Beacon Reach. I'm calling about the enquiry you left with us, where you asked about faster call-backs on web enquiries. Is now a reasonable time for a few minutes?
user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Is there a date you're working towards, or is it more of a when-we-get-to-it thing?
user: Ideally before the end of next month. We've got a busy period coming.
assistant: Can I get a sense of the size? How many agents would this be covering?
user: 18, across the two sites.
assistant: Great, that helps me a lot. Briefly, then: we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. From what you've told me about enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, that's <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, just so you know, I've only got about five minutes before my next meeting.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: That's fine, five minutes is plenty. In short: we ring every new web enquiry back within a minute, day or night, and hand the warm ones to your agents with the notes already written up. That's the piece that covers enquiries that come in overnight and go cold before anyone rings back, and brokerages we work with typically see the enquiry-to-viewing rate move from roughly one in ten to one in four. Does that sound right for you?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Interjection addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with what the user said when interrupting, rather than ignoring it.
3. Workflow resumed: after addressing the interjection, the response returns to the call flow with a fresh start.

user: Speaking. I've got a few minutes.
assistant: Can I ask what prompted the enquiry? Was it the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing, or a different problem?
user: It's that, and just generally not having enough hands to keep up.
assistant: Do you have a rough figure in mind for what you'd spend on this per month?
user: We'd stretch to about three thousand a month for the right thing.
assistant: That's useful, thank you. Let me tell you how we'd help. In short, we chase the paperwork by phone for you, log what comes back, and flag the ones that need escalating. Given what you said about the proof-of-delivery paperwork your dispatch team spend afternoons chasing, this is the <INTERRUPTED />
user: <INTERRUPTION>Sorry, quick one, can you speak up a bit? The line's a little faint at my end.</INTERRUPTION>

## Response under evaluation
assistant: piece that's missing for you, and operators we work with usually get paperwork turnaround down from days to hours. Does that sound like what you had in mind?

## Recovery criteria
1. Fresh start: the response does not resume or complete the assistant's previously cut-off sentence and instead starts a new utterance.
2. Interjection addressed: the response explicitly acknowledges and engages with what the user said when interrupting, rather than ignoring it.
3. Workflow resumed: after addressing the interjection, the response returns to the call flow with a fresh start.
